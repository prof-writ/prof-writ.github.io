  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>This course is an investigation of genres of professional and workplace communication that are common across the business world, including memos, reports, and presentations.</p>
  <p>We will practice writing in these genres this semester. However, our ultimate goal will not be to learn a particular handful of genres,
    but to develop practical strategies for writing in any new genres we may encounter in our future professional lives. These include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Developing clarity and concision at the sentence level</li>
    <li>Analyzing the conventions and document design of particular genres</li>
    <li>Developing writing relationships with others &ndash; which includes learning to give helpful feedback and to incorporate received feedback into the revision of your writing.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Being able to adapt to new forms of communication in the workplace is important because, as you all well know,
    communication in general is changing rapidly. Contemporary professional communication occurs across media platforms and through a variety of devices.
    Consequently, this course addresses a range of digital and visual communication strategies.</p>
  <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
  <p>The following learning outcomes must be met:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Compose in academic, professional, and/or workplaces genres related to a field of study.</li>
    <li>Apply writing processes common to the field.</li>
    <li>Compose and deliver a professional presentation.</li>
    <li>Describe the conventions of genres within a field.</li>
    <li>Make effective disciplinary and professional arguments.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Required Materials</h2>
  <h3>Books</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fish, Stanley. <i>How to Write a Sentence and How to Read One</i>. Harper, 2012. ISBN: 9780061840531</li>
    <li>Alred, Gerald, et al. <i>The Business Writer's Handbook</i>. 12th ed., Bedford/St. Martin's, 2020. ISBN: 9781319058494 (print), 9781319368661 (electronic)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Note:</em> You may acquire your books in whatever manner and medium is most accessible and available to you. However, each of these books
    may be easier to use in print format (though for very different reasons).</p>
  <h3>Electronic Resources</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Zoom: Where we will meet for class.</li>
    <li>Slack: This app is common in workplace environments. Those who market it and invest in it claim it may overtake email someday (though this is of course debatable).
      It is highly likely you will encounter it in your future professional endeavors, so we will be deploying it in our class. It is, essentially, a secure group chat
      application. You will communicate with your peer group here. You may also ask general questions about the course, share helpful links, or anything else you see fit.
      Helping your peers there is highly encouraged. I will also be available for private messaging, free from some of the formal constraints of emailing
      (constraints we will be talking about in class, by the way).</li>
    <li>Google products (Docs for conducting peer feedback, Forms for gathering data, Sheets and Slides for organizing, representing, and
      presenting that data, etc.)</li>
    <li>UBLearns: Here you will document your work for the class using the UBLearns portfolio. Grades and FERPA-protected information will also be communicated here.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Assignments</h3>
  <p><em>Cover Letter:</em> Cover letters are a way to communicate your suitability for a position to potential employers. You will write one to me, explaining your prior
    knowledge of and experience with writing professionally, and &ldquo;pitching&rdquo; your suitability for this course.</p>
  <p><em>Memos:</em> With the emergence of email, this genre has become out-of-date, but it is the form of workplace communication email was modeled after. Studying memos
    will afford us an opportunity to consider how genres change over time, as well as how older genres continue to influence current ones. They are also a simple way to
    start considering how documents are designed.</p>
  <p><em>Usability Study:</em> Usability studies, as the name implies, are documents that attempt to account for how usable something is. Whether that &ldquo;something&rdquo;
    is a website, a car, or a surgical tool, usability studies provide information about how it is used &mdash; does it function as intended? is it approachable? is it
    deployed in surprising ways? In a small group, you will conduct a usability study and document your findings. In addition to the written document, you will present your
    findings in a group <em>presentation</em>. You will also file a <em>progress report</em> to me along the way, informing me about how your group project is going,
    and what successes and difficulties you have encountered along the way.</p>
  <p><em>Marketing Report:</em> How do companies use social media? Acting as a consultant for an imaginary corporation, you will prepare a report documenting some
    best practices for their social media campaigns. You will research how corporate social media accounts develop their &ldquo;brand,&rdquo; both in the field
    (by observing what real social media accounts post) and theoretically (by consulting secondary research on social media management).</p>
  <p><em>UB Portfolio Submission:</em> If you are completing this course as part of your UB Curriculum requirements, please select an &ldquo;artifact&rdquo; from this course that is
    representative of your learning and save it in a safe location with a clear title. Your final UB Curriculum requirement, UBC 399: UB Curriculum Capstone, will require you
    to submit these &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo; as you process and reflect on your achievement and growth through the UB Curriculum. Artifacts include homework assignments, exams,
    research papers, projects, lab reports, presentations, and other coursework. For more information, see the UB Curriculum Capstone website:
    <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html" class="warp">https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html</a>.</p>
  <p><em>Peer Reviewing:</em> All major assignments in this course are subject to peer review. You will be assigned to a small group with your fellow students, and you
    will read each other's work throughout the semester, offering suggestions to each other on how to improve each other's writing. You should
    read your peers' writing like you read anything else in this class &mdash; carefully, thoughtfully, taking notes. Your feedback should be extensive, engaged, and
    critical where necessary. We will discuss strategies for providing excellent feedback more in class.</p>
  <p><em>Participation:</em> Participation is a significant component of this course. Though it is certainly more natural to have active, engaged conversations when
    we occupy the same room, it is still vitally important for your own success and our success as a class that you speak up, and often. As in the professional world,
    you have to get noticed to get ahead here. It is expected that you come to class having read what was assigned for the day, that you voice your opinions on what you
    have read, and that you respond in a kind, thoughtful manner to the insights of your peers.</p>
  <h2>Policies</h2>
  <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
  <p>You may be absent from class without an excuse three times this semester without penalty to your grade. After that, each additional unexcused absence will lower your grade by one-third
    of a letter. If you need to be excused from class for the day, you must inform me in advance.</p>
  <h3>Late Work</h3>
  <p>If you need an extension on a paper, you must inform me in advance. Late work will not be accepted without an extension.</p>
  <h3>Drafting</h3>
  <p>All writing in this class is the product of drafting and revision. If you fail to turn in a draft on time, you will not receive comments from your peers. A final
    draft that is not the product of a peer-review/revision cycle will be graded one letter lower than the quality of the work.</p>
  <h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>
  <p>Please familiarize yourself with the University’s Academic Integrity policy, which can be found at
    <a class="warp" href="https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html">https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html</a>. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned
    with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as “Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one’s own, without acknowledging and citing
    the particular debts to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one’s own.” The writing program’s policy states that the
    first instance of plagiarism will result in an “F” on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will result in failure of the course.</p>
  <h3>Incompletes</h3>
  <p>An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all
    but one of the written assignments.</p>
