  <p><em>TO:</em> Students of ENG210</p>
  <p><em>FROM:</em> Sam Helgeson</p>
  <p><em>DATE:</em> September 14, 2020</p>
  <p><em>SUBJECT:</em> Memo Assignment</p>
  <p>One good way to identify what you <i>should</i> write is to think about what you <i>shouldn’t</i>. Can’t think of a topic for that usability study? Well, you know it wouldn’t make sense to study the usability of peaches, and you can thereby eliminate fruits, and from there all the “natural” foods. You still don’t have a topic, but you’re closer. Can’t think of a header for that workplace memo? Well, you know that “Local Man Bites Bear” won’t work – that is characteristic of a quite different genre.</p>
  <p>So, in the interest of rounding out this semester, let’s think about what is <i>not</i> “professional writing.” I would like for you to write <i>the most unprofessional memo possible</i>.</p>
  <p>Let’s say you’ve worked at a certain company for five years, and you’ve hated every second of it. You’re ready to quit, and you’ve already been hired elsewhere, so you have no concerns about burning a few bridges.</p>
  <p>Your unprofessional memo should describe what has been frustrating you in the workplace these five long years. You’re so frustrated with it, in fact, that you might not even bother to proofread your memo. You’ll need to invent things the things that have been frustrating you. Some general categories of workplace complaints relate to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Resources (copy machine always broken);</li>
    <li>Teamwork (Jenny always dumps all the work on me);</li>
    <li>Shared spaces (rotten food in fridge);</li>
    <li>Draconian policies (I get punished for being 5 minutes late);</li>
    <li>Social climate (Ben from accounting is always rude);</li>
    <li>Communication (My manager does not make my tasks clear).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first draft of this assignment is due to your peer group on Friday, December 4. The final draft will be due to me on Friday December 11. It should be around 500 words.</p>
