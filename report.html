<p>You work at a business. It’s not a real business, though. You’re going to make it up, and you’re also going to make up what service it provides to the public at large. Maybe it builds houses, maybe it sells hot dogs, maybe it trims hedges, maybe it’s a hedge fund. In any case, let me know the name of your business and the service it performs in a brief proposal submitted to me by November 6.</p>
<p>Anyway, you work at this business and your CEO has noticed that there’s a problem: other businesses seem to have this thing called “social media,” and yours does not. But the CEO doesn’t understand how a “Face” can fit in a “Book,” thinks that “Twittering” is for the birds, and lies awake at night wondering why anyone would want an “Instant Gram” when you could have an eternity of grams instead. They’re absolutely clueless about social media, in other words. So, of course, they do what every CEO does in a crisis: make someone else fix the problem. And that someone is you.
</p>
<p>The CEO asks you to write a 1250-word Social Media Marketing Report. In this report, you’ll develop a “brand identity” for your imagined business. The report should function as a set of guidelines for the company’s social media manager or intern. What platforms should your business post to? What should the aesthetic of your business’s profile be? Bright and colorful, muted and pastel, angular or smooth, bold or subdued? What should the tone of the posts be? Funny or serious? Meme-based or all-original? Sarcastic or formal? What kinds of images or videos should be posted? Should the account respond to other business accounts? Should it offer “exclusives” or other promotional materials? And, as always, most importantly: What is the target audience of the account, and how will all these choices appeal to them?
</p>
<p>Of course, you probably already know what kinds of content brands post to their social media accounts, but your CEO wants you to back that knowledge up with evidence. You’ll do two kinds of research that you’ll document in the report. First, you’ll want to observe what kinds of posts businesses in a similar industry make. If you sell hot dogs, check out Oscar Meyer’s Twitter; if you sell makeup, look at Sephora’s Instagram; if you sell video games, watch some Twitch streams. Take some notes. What kinds of posts seem to work well? Funny posts? Posts that foreground the company’s ethical or socially responsible stance? Advertisements for free giveaways or other promotional events? </p>
<p>You’ll also want to do a little research on brand management. The UB Library is, again, your friend here (I recommend consulting the “eMarketer” service which you’ll find a link to <a href="https://research.lib.buffalo.edu/business-management">on this page</a>). But you can also just Google “social media branding tips,” “best practices for social media management,” etc. Alternatively, if you want to research things your corporate account should avoid, you might search for something like “corporate social media fails.” You could also do some research on your target demographic &mdash; what kinds of posts do they like? Two of these research sources should be included in the brief proposal due November 6, along with the name of your company and the service it performs.</p>
<p>The central challenge of this assignment, as I see it, is organizing all this information. You’ll want to include section headers (and, perhaps, subheaders). Reports in the marketing world often take a creative approach to organizing and presenting their findings. Your ability to engage your reader – both in terms of organization and tone – is what’s at stake here.</p>
<p>Your brief proposal, again, is due on Friday, November 6. The first draft of the full Social Media Marketing Report should be sent to your reviewer group by Friday, November 13. And the final draft is due Monday, November 23. And then you head off for Fall break!</p>
<p>What I want to see in this report:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clearly-defined “voice” your company will speak in online. If your business was a person, what kind of personality would it have?</li>
<li>Creativity in the manner you report the information.</li>
<li>Recommendations for which social media platforms your business should post on.</li>
<li>Recommendations for the aesthetic design of your account’s profile and posts.</li>
<li>Recommendations for when to post (All the time? To promote campaigns, events, discounts? In response to events in the news?).</li>
<li>An explanation of how these recommendations will appeal to your target audience, and what that target audience is. </li>
<li>Example posts from other businesses in the same industry (that work well, or don’t work well).</li>
<li>Research on social media brand management.</li>
<li>An “Executive Summary” at the beginning of the report, which summarizes its contents (even though it’s at the beginning, I would write this part last if I were you).</li>
<li>Headers throughout the rest of the report, which divide the information presented into manageable chunks. Your inventiveness in organizing the information is one of my evaluate criteria. </li>
<li>Optional, but recommended: a visual component. This could take the form of screenshots of posts, infographics, flowcharts, graphs, tables – anything that helps you get your point across. The source of this visual component should be cited clearly.</li>
</ul>
