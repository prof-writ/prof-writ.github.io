  <p>As a group, you will write a usability study on your chosen object. This is a longer assignment, and we'll be spending the next
    five weeks working on it. This will entail:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>researching your chosen object and usability in general; </li>
    <li>drafting subsections of the paper, and combining the best parts of each individual draft;</li>
    <li>managing your group;</li>
    <li>writing a progress report and creating a presentation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The final draft of this assignment should be at least 2,000 words. It should be submitted to me by October 30.</p>
  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>This assignment will contain primary and secondary research. </p>

  <p>Primary research will take the form of a survey (Google Forms works well). You should develop some questions which relate to the usability of your chosen object specifically, but here are some general ideas of what this survey <i>could</i> solicit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who uses your chosen object?</li>
    <li>How do they use it?</li>
    <li>For what do they use it?</li>
    <li>How often?</li>
    <li>When and where?</li>
    <li>What features do they use (or not)?</li>
    <li>How easy are these features to use?</li>
    <li>What materials do they access it with?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Multiple choice or Likert scales are preferred wherever possible. You want to generate numerical information.</p>

  <p>Secondary research, of course, entails background reading, which then reappears via quotation and summary in the “Literature Review” section of a usability study. Your literature review will be much stronger if you conduct your research on the UB Library's website rather than Google, but you can use either (or something else). Each of you should find and write about at least three secondary sources during the drafting stage, but the final draft can eliminate some of this writing if it seems out of place.</p>

  <p>You’ll notice that, in the examples I’ve provided you, this research can focus on the object of study, the research process, or usability studies themselves. Ideally there’d be a little of all three. Any citation style is acceptable, but be consistent, and include a “Bibliography,” “Works Cited,” or “References” page at the end of the document.</p>

  <h3>Drafting</h3>
  <p>Be democratic in the drafting process. Ideally, every other sentence would be written by a different group member, but of course this might not produce a very coherent paper. When you stitch together your various drafts, watch for what needs to be adapted to fit well with everything else.</p>

  <p>Go back and revise earlier material as you learn more. Your introduction, for example, might contain information or speculation that becomes unimportant or even incorrect as you conduct your research.</p>

  <p>A Google Doc you all can add to, subtract from, and revise seems like a shrewd way to proceed. If you’d like, you can invite me and I’ll give you some feedback along the way.</p>

  <h3>Group Management</h3>
  <p>I have provided you with two group management tools: the schedule and the progress report assignment. These are all you need to complete the assignment. However, since this is a <i>professional</i> writing class, you could also use this as an opportunity to practice your management skills. Write up timetables, delegate tasks, request information. Make decisions about what needs to be done, and when, and how.</p>

  <p>The timeline on the schedule will work well, and I encourage you to stick to it. But, as you may have noticed, by weeks 7, 8, and 9, I have given you only one task: “Continue collaboratively drafting your usability study.” You will need to decide what this means. Who’s working on the conclusion? Who’s creating and inserting charts or graphics? Who’s proofreading?</p>

  <p>In week 9, you’ll send me a progress report. This will be a memo-like document that lets me know how the group is doing. It’s the only assignment you won’t send to your peers this semester.</p>

  <h3>Presentation</h3>
  <p>There will be an individual assignment sheet for the presentation, and I’ll talk more about my expectations about it in class. But it will be relatively formal, it should include some kind of visual component (like a PowerPoint), and it will be about 10-15 minutes long.</p>
