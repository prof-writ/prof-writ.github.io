  <p>Please select an “artifact” from this course that is representative of your learning and save it
  in to our UBLearns course page under &ldquo;Portfolio Submission.&rdquo; Your final UB Curriculum requirement, UBC 399: UB Curriculum
  Capstone, will require you to submit these “artifacts” as you process and reflect on your achievement
  and growth through the UB Curriculum. Any paper you wrote this semester counts as an artifact &mdash;
  pick whichever was your favorite. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html">UB

  <p>I am attempting to make improve your future experience in the Capstone Course by making this
  a requirement. It is worth 5% of your grade. If you have already completed the Capstone, please
  just upload a paper from this semester anyway. Thanks everyone!
