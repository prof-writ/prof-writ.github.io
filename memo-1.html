  <p><em>TO:</em> Students of ENG210</p>
  <p><em>FROM:</em> Sam Helgeson</p>
  <p><em>DATE:</em> September 14, 2020</p>
  <p><em>SUBJECT:</em> Memo Assignment</p>
  <p>Your next writing task in this course is a memo. Memos are the internal communication documents of yesteryear; they have been replaced &mdash; with exceptions &mdash; by email. You might want to consider what the significance of writing one in 2020 is, and whether any of the conventions of the memo need to be altered to suit the contemporary communication world.</p>
  <p>This assignment should be sent to your peers by September 18. A revised copy is due to me by September 25. The document should be approximately 500 words.</p>
  <p><em>Topic</em></p>
  <p>Your memo should propose a topic for the assignment that follows it, the Usability Study. A usability study is a document that tries to assess whether some object or resource is useful, and how its users use it. Read the subsection of the syllabus on usability studies; you might also want to skim some example ones (find some on the syllabus, week five, or search in the UB library). Once you have a sense of what these documents do, brainstorm a little bit. What does it mean to use something? What does it mean for something to be usable? What would you like to spend time studying? Now you have the topic for your memo.</p>
  <p><em>Audience</em></p>
  <p>The audience for your memo is your peer group. We have read about audiences, in the Newkirk and Spinuzzi essays from week two, and one of the things I'm looking for in this assignment is your ability to write differently to different audiences. I want to see &ldquo;transactional,&rdquo; not &ldquo;pseudotransactional&rdquo; writing here. Although you might not think of them in this way, your classmates are professionals. How do you write for people in your professional organization who are the same rank as you? How do you balance the fact that you are crafting a professional document with the non-professional social relationships you have with your audience (if you have them)?</p>
  <p><em>Process and Formatting</em></p>
  <p>Your writing process for the memo should resemble that of the cover letter. Read and take notes on example memos, read the section of <i>The Business Writer's Handbook</i> about them. Come up with some subsection headers if you think that will make your document more readable. Use bulleted or numbered lists (but only if they will help your readers). And, again, consider if any of the normal conventions of memos should be violated to suit either the needs of your classmates or the 2020 communication context.</p>
