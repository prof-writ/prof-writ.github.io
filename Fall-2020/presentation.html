  <p>During the week of October 26-October 30, your group will present the findings of your usability study to the class. Your collective presentation should take around 18-20 minutes, and it should feature a visual component (such as a PowerPoint or a set of Google Slides). Each group member should speak.</p>
  <p>The most obvious approach would be to orally summarize the contents of your usability study. This is completely acceptable, and is the baseline requirement for the presentation. </p>
  <p>However, I am giving your group absolute freedom for your allotted 20 minutes: the classroom is yours. The best presentation is one where your audience feels like they actually learned something (and maybe even enjoyed themselves). Consider that you are presenting to an audience of fellow students – what would make your presentation an enjoyable, engaging experience for them? Jokes? A short activity, game, or quiz? Time for questions? A video clip (a very short one, of course)? GIFs? What are the most effectual means to enlighten and engage your fellow classmates on a topic? </p>
  <p>My evaluation of your presentation is strictly based on the quality of your planning. Matters of execution – breaks in eye contact, nerves, or having to consult your notes – are less important.</p>
