    Before submitting each writing assignment to me, you will submit it to your classmates for review. Your reviews of your classmates' writing are worth 10% of your final grade. Here are some tips for earning a good grade on peer reviewing:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The minimum expectation is a 250-500 word comment (more is better) on your classmate's paper. If providing your classmate with track changes is also helpful, I encourage you to do so, but this is optional.
    </li>
    <li>
      Think of your classmate's paper as a collection of sentences, paragraphs, and ideas, not as a whole. The paper is not yet &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; but parts of it are one or the other. Which parts? Praise the good and give advice for the bad.
    </li>
    <li>
      Questions you might try to answer:
      <ul>
        <li>Is the paper responding to the assignment?</li>
        <li>Is there information in the paper that is out of place? Or is there information that is not included but should be?</li>
        <li>Is high-priority information given low priority, or vice versa?</li>
        <li>Could passages of the paper be more clear?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Grammar, spelling, etc. should <em>not</em> be your focus. Prioritize ideas and communication quality. You should only <em>very rarely</em> comment on the mechanics of your classmate's writing.
    </li>
