  <p><em>To:</em> Students of Professional Writing</p>
  <p><em>From:</em> Sam Helgeson</p>
  <p><em>Subject:</em> Progress Report Assignment</p>
  <p>The progress report, or activity report, is a formal document that reports on the status of a task to a manager or
    other authority. Please write one about your group's progress on the usability study, addressed to me. It should be
    approximately 500 words, and it should be submitted to me (and me only) by Friday, October 16.
  </p>
  <p><em>Method of Composition</em></p>
  <p>You should compose this assignment, like all others in this course, by consulting examples. <i>The Business Writer's
    Handbook</i> contains an example of both a &ldquo;progress report&rdquo; and an &ldquo;activity report&rdquo; &ndash;
    both formats are acceptable. Other formats you encounter online are also acceptable.
  </p>
  <p>Like a memo, progress reports often contain subheaders. Here are some potential ones you <i>could</i> include (but
    do not include all of them):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Work Completed:</em> A brief statement of what components of your usability study your group is satisfactorily
      finished with.</li>
    <li><em>Work Scheduled:</em> An outline of work yet to be completed. This should include specific dates your group plans
      to complete specific tasks. It could also outline which group member is working on which task.</li>
    <li><em>Projects:</em> Like &ldquo;Works Scheduled,&rdquo; this should address the ongoing subtasks of the usability study,
      with a concrete outline of your plans for completing them.</li>
    <li><em>Problems:</em> A place to note important setbacks or issues of concern.</li>
    <li><em>Requests:</em> A place to ask me for guidance or clarification related to the completion of the usability study.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Central Goals</em></p>
  <p>To develop a professional yet honest tone of address to me, your instructor.</p>
  <p>To develop a plan for completing the usability
    study, and communicate that plan concretely and clearly.</p>
